                <p>Around 1.3 million Thai small businesses have been affected
                    by the
                    impact of COVID-19—from clothes
                    manufacturer Chu Su Mo in Chiang Mai, to coffee shops like
                    Hidden Tree
                    Garden in Samut Songkhram.
                    These businesses are often at the heart of their
                    communities,
                    supporting local jobs and services.
                    They’re also critical to the Thai economy as a whole,
                    accounting for
                    more than 90 percent of all
                    businesses in the country. As Thailand rebuilds from the
                    pandemic,
                    we’re focused on supporting its
                    business owners through the economic recovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, at our virtual Google for Thailand event, we launched
                    Saphan Digital: a new Grow with Google program to help small
                    businesses and other organisations learn digital skills and
                    make the most of online opportunities. (In Thai, “Saphan”
                    means bridge, and this program is designed to help bridge
                    the digital gap between Thais who know how to use the
                    internet and those that can’t.)
                </p>
                <p>Throughout the pandemic, we’ve seen the importance of the
                    internet in enabling businesses to continue operating—even
                    if it’s something simple like letting customers know they’re
                    still open, or offering information about online shopping
                    and delivery options. Saphan Digital will equip business
                    owners, NGOs and workers to use digital tools and set up a
                    basic online presence, as well as provide online training
                    courses in business and digital skills—covering topics like
                    e-commerce and creating a digital storefront. After
                    completing the training, people taking part will be able to
                    “pair” with a small business or NGO to apply what they’ve
                    learned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program is a partnership with Thailand’s Ministry of
                    Commerce and backed by local and international businesses,
                    with corporate partners like LnwShop and BentoWeb providing
                    tools and mentoring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Saphan is part of a bigger effort to ensure Thais can use
                    technology with confidence—one we’re expanding to support
                    the country’s coronavirus response.

                    Existing Google initiatives like Academy Bangkok are now
                    offering online courses for graduates and experienced
                    professionals, while The Asia Foundation’s Go Digital ASEAN
                    program—supported by Google.org—is helping Thai
                    micro-entrepreneurs in 20 provinces who wouldn’t otherwise
                    have access to digital training. For students and teachers,
                    we announced today that we’ll be integrating G Suite for
                    Education into Thailand’s Digital Education Excellence
                    Platform, meaning that all Thai public schools will be able
                    to access Google’s education tools free of charge.
