                <div class="p402_premium" id="main_text">
                    <p>For years I’ve wondered what it’s like behind the protected 
                        walls of a Google data center, and I’m not alone. In my job 
                        at Google, I spend my days working with developers. Our data 
                        centers are crucial to the work that they do, but most have 
                        never actually set foot inside a data center. And until 
                        recently, neither had I. I went on a mission to find answers 
                        to common questions like: Why are visits so tightly 
                        restricted? How secure is a Google data center? How do we 
                        meet regulatory requirements? Here's what I found out.
                    </p>
                    <p>To keep our customers' data safe, we need to make sure the 
                        physical structure of the data center is absolutely secure. 
                        Each data center is protected with six layers of physical 
                        security designed to thwart unauthorized access. Watch the 
                        video above to follow my journey through these layers to 
                        the core of a data center, and read on to learn even more.

                        There are two rules strictly enforced at all Google data 
                        centers. The “least privilege” protocol is the idea that 
                        someone should have only the bare minimum privileges 
                        necessary to perform their job. If your least privilege 
                        is to enter Layer 2, you won’t have luck moving to Layer 
                        3. Each person’s access permissions are checked at badge 
                        readers that exist at every access point in a data center 
                        facility. Authorization measures happen everywhere using 
                        this protocol. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another rule exists that prevents a vehicle or individual 
                        closely following another to gain entry into a restricted 
                        area without a badge swipe. If the system detects a door 
                        open for too long, it immediately alerts security personnel. 
                        Any gate or door must close before the next vehicle or 
                        person can badge in and gain access.
                    </p>

                    <p>You’ve probably seen dual-authentication when you try to 
                        sign into an account and a one-time password is sent to 
                        your phone. We take a similar approach at the data centers 
                        to verify a person’s identity and access. At some layers 
                        in the data center, you’re required to swipe your badge, 
                        then enter a circle lock, or tubular doorway. You walk into 
                        a special "half portal" that checks your badge and scans 
                        your eyes to gain access to the next layer of the data center. 
                        It prevents tailgating because only one person is allowed 
                        in the circle lock at a time.

                        The facility loading docks are a special section of Layer 3, 
                        used to receive and send shipments of materials, such as 
                        new hardware. Truck deliveries must be approved for access 
                        to Layer 3 to enter the dock. For further security, the 
                        loading dock room is physically isolated from the rest of 
                        the data center, and guard presence is required when a 
                        shipment is received or sent.

                        Hard drive tracking is important to the security of your 
                        data because hard drives contain encrypted sensitive information. 
                        Google meticulously tracks the location and status of every 
                        hard drive within our data centers—from acquisition to 
                        destruction—using barcodes and asset tags. These asset 
                        tags are scanned throughout a hard drive's lifecycle in 
                        a data center from the time it’s installed to the time it's 
                        removed from circulation. Tracking hard drives closely 
                        ensures they don’t go missing or end up in the wrong hands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also make sure hard drives are properly functioning by 
                        doing frequent performance tests. If a component fails to 
                        pass a performance test, it’s deemed no longer usable. To 
                        prevent any sensitive information from living on that disk, 
                        we remove it from inventory to be erased and destroyed in 
                        Layer 6, Disk Erase. There, the disk erase formatter uses 
                        a multi-step process that wipes the disk data and replaces 
                        each bit of data with zeros. If the drive can’t be erased 
                        for any reason, it’s stored securely until it can be 
                        physically destroyed.
