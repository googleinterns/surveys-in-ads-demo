                <p>Through lockdown, many of us found that online tools
                    have been a real lifeline. We’ve used them to find
                    information and stay connected with our communities,
                    support local businesses, teach our children and learn
                    new skills ourselves. The same tools will be vital in
                    helping countries recover more quickly and more sustainably.
                </p>
                <p>That’s why Google is making a new pledge to help 10
                    million people and businesses in Europe, the Middle East
                    and Africa (EMEA) find jobs, digitize and grow over the
                    next 18 months.
                </p>
                <p>Long before the coronavirus, it was clear the jobs of the
                    future would require a new set of digital skills, so we
                    launched Grow with Google to help people learn new skills.
                    We were blown away by the demand, and by what people went on
                    to achieve, and in five years we’ve trained over 14 million
                    people in EMEA and 70 million around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We’ve seen a tripling of demand for this training during
                    lockdown. To help even more families, communities and
                    businesses recover faster, we’re investing in new,
                    targeted programs. For example, we will be covering the
                    costs for 100,000 people to take the Google IT Support
                    Professional Certificate which prepares people for a
                    career in IT. Fifty thousand of these places are
                    reserved for under-served groups who otherwise face
                    real barriers to learning (such as language, caring
                    responsibilities or financial difficulty). Google.org
                    will fund local nonprofits to provide the tailored
                    support these people require to successfully complete
                    the course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To help people find new job opportunities, we’ll launch
                    our job search tool in more countries in EMEA. We are
                    testing new features for the recovery—such as helping
                    you find jobs that let you work from home. Job search
                    is built in partnership with job boards, local employment
                    agencies and others, like Pôle Emploi in France,
                    Bayt.com in the Middle East and Monster.de in Germany,
                    and it also helps them by finding job seekers with the
                    right skills faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We’ve learned over the last five years that we need to
                    do more to reach those whose existing jobs are most at
                    risk of disruption by new technology. Two years ago, we
                    allocated 100 million in Google.org grants, to be
                    disbursed over five years to organizations across
                    Europe, the Middle East and Africa that focus on digital
                    skills and economic opportunity. Today, we're announcing
                    that $15 million of that funding will go to nonprofits
                    that help workers and small business owners who are
                    technologically, financially or socially excluded with
                    critical digital skills and access to jobs.
